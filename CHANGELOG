=== 0.5.7 ===

=== 0.5.6 ===
* Added build of static library.
* Source code now more properly references LGPL3+ license.

=== 0.5.5 ===
* Provided C-compatible function interface and symbol exports. All C functions and
  types are prefixed with lsp_dsp_ prefix to not to clash with other types. C++
  interface has not changed, all functions and data types are still in lsp::dsp namespace.

=== 0.5.4 ===
* Added pkg-config file generation.

=== 0.5.3 ===
* Added pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added SSE optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added AVX optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added ARMv7 optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added AArch64 optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Fixed bugs in msmatrix conversion functions for AVX and SSE.
* Fixed bugs in sse::bilinear_transform_x1 routine.

=== 0.5.2 ===
* Updated build system.
* Code refactoring.
* Added openBSD support in build.

=== 0.5.1 ===
* Some minor code refactoring.

=== 0.5.0 ===
* Initial release.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 32-bit i586 architecture.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 64-bit x86_64 architecture.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 32-bit ARMv7 architecture.
