=== 0.5.13 ===

=== 0.5.12 ===
* Submitted x86/x86_64 SSE2-optimized linear interpolation functions.
* Submitted x86/x86_64 AVX2-optimized linear interpolation functions.
* Submitted ARMv7 NEON-optimized linear interpolation functions.
* Submitted AArch64 ASIMD-optimized linear interpolation functions.
* Updated build system.

=== 0.5.11 ===
* Improved build: fixed many GCC warnings.
* DSP library can now be compiled with Clang C++ compiler.

=== 0.5.10 ===
* Updated build scripts.
* Reviewed generic abgr32_to_bgrff function implementation for Big endian platforms.
* Submitted x86/x86_64 SSE2-optimized function abgr32_to_bgrff.
* Submitted x86/x86_64 AVX2-optimized function abgr32_to_bgrff.
* Submitted ARMv7 NEON-optimized function abgr32_to_bgrff.
* Submitted AArch64 ASIMD-optimized function abgr32_to_bgrff.
* Fixed lacking export for SSE2-optimized functions support: fmmod3, fmrmod3, fmmod4, fmrmod4.
* Added support of AMD Zen 2 architecture for CPU tuning.
* More careful AVX2 support detection for AMD processors.
* Fixed improper RGBA to HSLA conversion in rgba_to_hsla routine.

=== 0.5.9 ===
* Updated build scripts that now use tags without prefixes first.

=== 0.5.8 ===
* Fixed excessive header installation with proper one.
* Fixed installation and deinstallation of shared object and library files.
* Added `make distsrc` target to build tarball with all required source code.

=== 0.5.7 ===
* Updated makefiles: added `make tree` target.

=== 0.5.6 ===
* Added build of static library.
* Source code now more properly references LGPL3+ license.

=== 0.5.5 ===
* Provided C-compatible function interface and symbol exports. All C functions and
  types are prefixed with lsp_dsp_ prefix to not to clash with other types. C++
  interface has not changed, all functions and data types are still in lsp::dsp namespace.

=== 0.5.4 ===
* Added pkg-config file generation.

=== 0.5.3 ===
* Added pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added SSE optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added AVX optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added ARMv7 optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Added AArch64 optimizations for pmin, pmax, psmin, psmax, pamin, pamax functions.
* Fixed bugs in msmatrix conversion functions for AVX and SSE.
* Fixed bugs in sse::bilinear_transform_x1 routine.

=== 0.5.2 ===
* Updated build system.
* Code refactoring.
* Added openBSD support in build.

=== 0.5.1 ===
* Some minor code refactoring.

=== 0.5.0 ===
* Initial release.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 32-bit i586 architecture.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 64-bit x86_64 architecture.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 32-bit ARMv7 architecture.
* Supports SIMD optimizations for 64-bit AArch64 architecture.
